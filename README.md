# House Price Prediction
When you ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, they probably won't start by mentioning the height of the basement ceiling or how close it is to an east-west railroad. However, this dataset from a playground competition shows that many factors influence price negotiations beyond just the number of bedrooms or having a white-picket fence.

This competition involves 79 different variables that describe nearly every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to predict the final price of each home using this detailed information.

In my Jupyter notebook solution, I follow the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: I create visualizations to understand the data better.
2. Data Cleaning: I prepare the data by handling missing values and correcting errors.
3. Feature Engineering: I create new features from the existing ones to improve the model.
4. Modeling: I build and train models to predict the house prices.
